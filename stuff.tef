=narration
$content/$format: text/plain

Hi, and welcome to this TEF file of random stuff.

=log 2019-12-11
$content/$format: text/plain

I want to be able to edit parts of .tef files as org files.
Maybe I can do this with narrowing: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Narrowing.html

So we can use

  'C-x n n' or '(narrow-to-region)'

to narrow to the region, and

  'C-x n w' or '(widen)' to get back out of it.

Blah blah, stuff about 'artifacts as data source'.
'artifact' meaning 'file', basically.
And you can build up a database from a bunch of files.
The database can be rebuilt any time.

Money doesn't buy pleasure, ever.  You need skill.


=example An org-formatted entry
$content/$format: text/org

** Header 2
*** Header 3

Hopefully this doesn't mess


=example An different org-formatted entry, with a table
$content/$format: text/org
comment: It's tricky to edit org tables without being in org-mode.
comment: Therefore I'd like to be able to easily edit org chunks within TEF files!

| A table               | Yes      |
|-----------------------+----------|
| asd                   |          |
| More stuff            | oh yeah! |
| Let's add another row | 42       |

Ooh, this person's doing something similar to what I am.
https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2191/copy-contents-of-current-buffer-in-a-temp-buffer-and-operate-on-that

Maybe I actually want an 'indirect buffer', not a 'narrowed' one.

And oh, there should be a command in TEF mode that runs certain elisp
sections marked in a certain way to get you in the mood.
I would run it by default except that would be a huge vulnerability.
I could use that for my exercise log file.

$content/$format: text/org

~$content~, ~$content/$format~, ~$content/$encoding~ headers.

Dollar sign indicates that these fields are 'syntactic',
they are about the TEF representation of an object,
rather than the object itself.
This kind of jives with "$ref" having special meaning in JSON objects
and "$"-prefixed 'special' properties in the Homie MQTT convention
(though I think Homie went overboard with the dollar signs).

Similarly, a 'comment' header would be passed on to the application,
whereas '$comment' is about the TEF encoding of the object
(though '#'-prefixed lines would accomplish the same thing).
And a '=$narration' entry is TEF-level narration.

In general, "$"-prefixed entry types and attributes should
not be presented to the application, with the exception of ~$content~,
which is the 'primary content' of an entry, whose meaning is application-defined,
so can't be given a good name
(for a log entry, 'content' might be descriptive, but for a description
of a physical object, 'notes' might make more sense.
Hence using a "$" to make it clear that the "$content"
is referring to 'content' at the syntactic level).

~$encoding~ is special because it indicates that the text that appears
in the TEF stream is not the true text, but the text after being encoded,
and so it must be decoded to get the true text.

~type~ is just metadata, and so is not special,
though it may be common.

~$ref~, similar to its use in JSON, indicates a reference to a value.
e.g.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
=image
short-description: A picture of moldy raspberries

source-ref: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Major-Mode-Conventions.html#Major-Mode-Conventions

The key sequences bound in a major mode keymap should usually start
with C-c, followed by a control character, a digit, or {, }, <, >, :
or ;. The other punctuation characters are reserved for minor modes,
and ordinary letters are reserved for users.


=attribute http://ns.nuke24.net/TEF/content

The content of a TEF entry.

=#attribute http://ns.nuke24.net/TEF/text
short-name: $text

The text representation of any given value (of any header or of $content).
Implied in TEF syntax, except to explicitly indicate metadata about text, e.g.
with a header 'some-property/$text/$format'.

This needs more thought.
It might be that in cases where the textual representation of a property
is not itself the conceptual value of the property,
that associating metadata with the text is silly.

=attribute http://ns.nuke24.net/TEF/content
short-name: $content

Content of a TEF entry.

=attribute http://purl.org/dc/terms/format
short-name: $format

Textual representation of the format, probably of text,
probably in the MIME "<type>/<subtype>" format.

e.g. "text/html"

=task
status: todo
$content/$format: text/org

the tef-mode keybindings should be customizable I think, or be a menu system thing.

Keys should be defined using ~use-local-map~

=task
status: todo

tef-mode should say "TEF" or something


=task
status: done

Use an indirect buffer for editing entry as org.


=task
status: todo

Fix up TEF mode more.


=task
status: todo

Syntax highlighting in TEF mode?
