# TOGoS's Entry Format (TEF)

A file format designed to store a series of objects in flexible and human and machine-readable way,
inspired by Perl POD and MIME.

Useful when you want to record facts, thoughts, logs, or conceptual objects
in a linear way for later processing.

I've been using this format for over a decade

See [stuff.tef](./stuff.tef) for example.
Or [music.txt](http://www.nuke24.net/music/music.txt),
which is used to generate [the music page on my website](http://www.nuke24.net/music/).
My [project log entries](http://www.nuke24.net/plog/entries/) are also written
in this format, but with each file being a self-contained entry.

This repo may eventually include libraries for parsing.
